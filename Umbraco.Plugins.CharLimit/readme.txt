Char Limit Restrict

former Char Limit Property Editor

A textbox or textarea based on character limit (textbox for less than 100, and textarea for over 100 characters) that counts the number of characters and blocks further typing of limit is reached. Based off the Char Limit Demo from Nibble http://www.nibble.be/?p=285 but more visually rich.
