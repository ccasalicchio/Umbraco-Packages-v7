# Page Visit Counter for Umbraco 7.3.1+

Is a statistics counter for individual pages

Has a simple label property editor that shows how many times the page has been visited.

It creates a macro, macro partial view, and a data type.

Add the data type to your document type, add the macro to the template, and start counting

This package saves the node everytime it is visited, to increase the counter, so, per Sebastiaan Janssen's suggestion:
 *"please only use this package on very low traffic websites which you don't expect to grow above a few dozen visits a day"*
